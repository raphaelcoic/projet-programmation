class Graph:

    A minimal class for directed weighted graph represented as adjacency list.

    -----------
    edges: dict
        A dictionary that contains the list of neighbors of each node with its weight.
        Ex: edges = {v0: [(v1, 21), (v2, 12)], 
                     v1: [(v0, 74), (v2, 32)], 
                     ...}

    --------
    neighbours(self, node): 
        Returns the list of all neighbors of a node
